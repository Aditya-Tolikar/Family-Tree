# Family-Tree
This was my Data Structures Project

The function made for loading a saved file has too many arguments, so if you want to use it you'll need to make it uasble.

Consider this piece of code as an example of how NOT to go about making a project:
  The code can neither be called funtion oriented nor can it be called OOP.
  Some functions are made in such a way that aren't very useful
  The only constraint was the time limitation and I did not think how far to the Application end I wanted to make this project.
  
  As a result, this is neither good enough for a standalone program (even if you fix the loading) nor is it a good backend.
  
Now, I could fix this code and make it more usable, but I have more interesting projects in hand right now.
However, if someone is genuinely interested in having a program in which to store a Family Tree, then pm me and I will convert this thing into a usable backend (given enough time).
